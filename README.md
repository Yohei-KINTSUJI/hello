## Self introduction
Hello everyone. My name is Yohei KINTSUJI(金辻 陽平). Please call me 'kinchan.'
I'm in the ES2 Laboratory: Computer Engineering.
Actually, the research thema is not decided yet, but now I'm currently working on research on task switching that will be  be announced at the end of June.

Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed by classes, job hunting, and research.
